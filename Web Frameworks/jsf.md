##JSF

JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a Java specification for building component-based user interfaces for web applications.
It was formalized as a standard through the Java Community Process and is part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.

JSF 2 uses Facelets as its default templating system. Other view technologies such as XUL can also be employed. 
In contrast, JSF 1.x uses JavaServer Pages (JSP) as its default templating system.
